1. Initialize variables:
   - incoming, outgoing, buck_size, n, store = 0

2. Input values:
   - Prompt the user to enter buck_size, outgoing, and n
   - Read buck_size, outgoing, and n from the user

3. Loop for each packet i from 1 to n:
   a. Prompt the user to enter the size of the incoming packet (incoming)
   b. If incoming > (buck_size - store), adjust incoming to fit the remaining bucket space
   c. Add incoming to store (bucket content)
   d. Print the current bucket buffer size (store) and total bucket size (buck_size)
   e. If store >= outgoing, subtract outgoing from store
      - Else, set store to 0

4. End of loop

5. End of program
